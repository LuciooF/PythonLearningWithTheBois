# PythonLearningWithTheBois
This project was created when me and a couple friends wanted to start learning python, I have experience with coding but have never tried Python, 
my friends have watched a couple videos but have never really coded.
So we're googling different project ideas and doing them, getting harder projects each time.
Currently being made by me and @olivercook197, also being monitored by nosey @samcparker D:<
